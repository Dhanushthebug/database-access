Great question! Here’s how you can **check if an image is single-channel (grayscale) or 3-channel (color)** using Python with OpenCV or NumPy:

---

### Using OpenCV (`cv2`) and NumPy:

```python
import cv2

# Load image (change path to your image)
img = cv2.imread('path_to_your_image.png')

# Check shape
print(img.shape)
```

---

### What the shape tells you:

* If shape is like `(height, width)`, **image is grayscale (single channel)**
* If shape is like `(height, width, 3)`, **image is color (3 channels - BGR in OpenCV)**
* If shape is like `(height, width, 4)`, **image has 4 channels (e.g., RGBA)**

---

### Example outputs:

```python
# For grayscale image:
(224, 224)  # means single channel

# For color image:
(224, 224, 3)  # means 3 channels

# For RGBA image:
(224, 224, 4)  # means 4 channels
```

---

### Important:

* If you use `cv2.imread('file.png')` by default, OpenCV loads **color image with 3 channels**.
* To **force grayscale loading**, use:

```python
img_gray = cv2.imread('file.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
print(img_gray.shape)  # Should print (height, width) without channel dimension
```

---

### Quick check with NumPy alone:

```python
import numpy as np

# Suppose img is a NumPy array
print(img.ndim)  # 2 means single channel, 3 means multi-channel
print(img.shape) # shows shape info
```

Got it! Python 3.12.7 works perfectly with OpenCV and NumPy as usual — no special changes needed for this.

Here’s a simple Python 3.12.7 compatible script to **check whether an image is single-channel (grayscale) or 3-channel (color)** using OpenCV:

```python
import cv2

def check_image_channels(image_path: str):
    # Load the image using OpenCV (default loads as color if available)
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)

    if img is None:
        print(f"Error: Could not load image at {image_path}")
        return

    shape = img.shape
    if len(shape) == 2:
        print(f"The image at '{image_path}' is grayscale (single channel). Shape: {shape}")
    elif len(shape) == 3:
        channels = shape[2]
        if channels == 1:
            print(f"The image at '{image_path}' has 1 channel (grayscale). Shape: {shape}")
        elif channels == 3:
            print(f"The image at '{image_path}' is a color image (3 channels). Shape: {shape}")
        elif channels == 4:
            print(f"The image at '{image_path}' has 4 channels (e.g., RGBA). Shape: {shape}")
        else:
            print(f"The image at '{image_path}' has {channels} channels. Shape: {shape}")
    else:
        print(f"Unexpected image shape: {shape}")

# Example usage:
image_path = "C:/Users/Dhanush/Desktop/segmentation_data/images/sample_image.png"
check_image_channels(image_path)
```

---

### How it works:

* Loads image with `cv2.imread()`
* Checks `img.shape` length:

  * 2 dims → grayscale
  * 3 dims → channels dimension present
* Prints appropriate message

---

If you want to **force load as grayscale and check**:

```python
img_gray = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
print(f"Grayscale loaded shape: {img_gray.shape}")  # Always 2D (height, width)
```
